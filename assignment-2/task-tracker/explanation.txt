In this task management app, I added features like viewing, adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Each task has a title, description, due date, priority, and category, with tasks color-coded based on their priority and category. I also made it so you can mark tasks as complete and see if they’re overdue. The tasks are saved in a data.json file, so they’re preserved across app restarts.

What I Learned:

This project helped me get hands-on with Node.js for file handling, and I used inquirer to make the app interactive through CLI prompts. I also got to work with TypeScript for type safety and structuring my code properly. One thing I learned is how to manage asynchronous file operations and validate user input—especially tricky stuff like due dates. The whole thing was a good exercise in building a simple, reusable class and managing state. Challenges Faced? A couple of challenges I faced were running the app, persistent app crashing, making sure the due date was in the right format and handling tasks when users tried to complete or delete tasks that didn’t exist. I had to make sure the app was still smooth even if something went wrong, like if a user entered an invalid date or a non-existent task number.
